[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Main structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is contains 3 main view parts - `CalendarPanel`, `ListPanel`, `LogPanel`. It also holds several other UI parts e.g. `PopUpPanel` and `Command Box`. Every one of the UI classes will abstract from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework, and layout of these UI parts are defined in `.fxml` files which are found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. One example of the layout would be: link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`], whose FXML link is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]




The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user two different types commands using the `Logic` component.
** One command, when executed, affect the actual Events.
** The other command is executed to change the view of the UI. There are currently 3 main views in the application: `CalendarPanel`, `ListPanel`, `LogPanel`.
* It listens for any changes in the list of events using a listener:  link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/listeners/EventListListener.java[`EventListListener`].
* It also listens for the output to the user with another listener: link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listeners/UserOutputListener.java[`UserOutputListener`].

==== Calendar UI View

.Structure of the Calendar UI View
image::UiCalendarClassDiagram.png[]

The Calendar View is made up of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/CalendarPanel.java[`CalendarPanel`], which holds several different other UI parts linked together to form the overall UI. In the Calendar View, it displays two UI parts of the Calendar: `CalendarScreen` and `TimelineView`.

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/CalendarScreen.java[`CalendarScreen`] is the screen which displays the calendar of a certain month and year to the user. It contains 6 x 7 instance of `CalendarGridDay`, which displays the days of the month.

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/TimelineView.java[`TimelineView`] is the screen which displays the timeline using 3 different classes which abstract from `TimelineView`.

* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/TimelineDayView.java[`TimelineDayView`] displays the timeline of a particular day in a certain month and year.
* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/TimelineWeekView.java[`TimelineWeekView`] displays the timeline of a particular week. The week is according to the `CalendarScreen`, where each row represents a week of a month.
* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/calendar/TimelineMonthView.java[`TimelineMonthView`] displays the timeline of a particular month in a certain year.

Each of these timeline will hold up to a certain amount of `CardHolder` depending on the type of `TimelineView`. Each of these `CardHolder` will then hold an amount of EventCards for displaying the event name and date.

==== List UI View

.Structure of the List UI View
image::UiListClassDiagram.png[]

The List View is made up of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/list/ListPanel.java[`ListPanel`] which contains two lists views, `EventListView` and `TaskListView`

* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/list/EventListView.java[`EventListView`] displays the list of Events containing every piece of information of the Events.

* link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/list/TaskListView.java[`TaskListView`] displays the list of Task, containing every piece of information of each Task. [__To be implemented__]

Similar to `TimelineView`, `EventListView` and `TaskListView` will contain a list of `Card`, but it will not be held in the `CardHolder`.

==== Log UI View

.Structure of the Log UI View
image::UiLogClassDiagram.png[]

The Log View is made up of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/log/LogPanel.java[`LogPanel`] which contains several instances of `LogBox`.

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/panel/log/LogBox.java[`LogBox`] displays literal information back to the user when it is called by `MainWindow` when it listens for a command.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== CommandManager component

==== Command

A `Command` is defined to be an immutable function, that can be invoked at any time, to perform any set of instructions. After executing the set of instructions, it will optionally return output to be displayed to the user.

In Horo, a `Command` implemented as an abstract class with an abstract `execute()` method. To create a new concrete command, extend from `Command` and implement `execute()`.

.Class diagram of Commands
image::CommandManager.png[]

If your concrete command requires any dependencies during execution, it is recommended to pass in the dependency from the constructor.

For example, if your command needs to be able to access `ModelManager`:
```
public class MyCommand extends Command {
	private final ModelManager model;
	MyCommand(ModelManager model) {
		this.model = model;
	}

	@Override
    CommandOutput execute() {
        this.model.doSomething();
		...
	}
}
```


==== CommandParser

A `CommandParser` is defined to be able to parse a `String` of user input, and return a `Command`.

In Horo, a `CommandParser` is implemented as a finite state machine (FSM). It parses user input token by token, and it transitions from state to state depending on the next token.

What the FSM is trying to do is tokenize user input into:

1. `Command keyword`
2. `Command phrase(s)`

A *command keyword* is defined as the first sequence of consecutive, non-whitespace characters of the user input. For the rest of this guide, a sequence of consecutive, non-whitespace characters will be referred to as a ‚Äòword‚Äô. A word can be described in the form of a regular expression (regex) as `[^\s]+`.

Examples of valid command keywords:

- `exit`
- `add_event`
- `123`
- `üò∫`

A *command phrase* is defined as either a word, or multiple words delimited by whitespace surrounded by quotes. Command phrases come after a command keyword.

Examples of valid command phrases:

- `Horse`
- `‚ÄùHomework‚Äù`
- `‚ÄùHoro‚Äôs Birthday‚Äù`
- `‚Äù24/10/2019 07:00‚Äù`
- `‚Äô24/10/2019 07:00‚Äô`
- `--description`

A valid command contains exactly one command keyword, and zero or more command phrases.

`[keyword] [phrase] [phrase] [phrase] ...`

.State diagram of CommandParser
image::CommandParser.png[]

After tokenizing, the command keyword is sent to a `CommandKeywordParser`, which returns a `CommandBuilder`. The remaining command phrases are sent to the `CommandBuilder`, which returns the `Command` we want.


==== CommandKeywordParser

A `CommandKeywordParser` is defined to be able to parse a command keyword, and return a `CommandBuilder`.

In Horo, a `CommandKeywordParser` uses a `HashMap` to map a command keyword to a `Supplier<CommandBuilder>`.


==== CommandBuilder

A `CommandBuilder` is defined to be able to accept an arbitrary amount of command settings, and eventually create a `Command` using those settings.

In Horo, a `CommandBuilder` is implemented such that the entire definition of a `Command` is in the `CommandBuilder`. The `CommandBuilder` will use those definitions to automagically parse command phrases.

The definition of a command is split into two parts:

1. `Command argument(s)`
2. `Command option(s)`

A *command option* is defined to have a keyword and a list of arguments.
An *option‚Äôs keyword* is defined to be a command phrase.
An *option‚Äôs argument* is defined to be a command phrase that is not an option‚Äôs keyword. An option‚Äôs argument is a command phrase that lies after the option‚Äôs keyword.

Example of option‚Äôs keyword & arguments below. The option‚Äôs keyword is underlined:

- `+++<u>--description</u>+++ Horse`
- `+++<u>--tags</u>+++ Animal Cat Dog`
- `+++<u>-d</u>+++ Horse`

A *command argument* is defined to be a command phrase that is not an option‚Äôs keyword. This is similar to an option‚Äôs argument, except that the position of this argument in the user input is important. A command argument is a command phrase that lies after the command keyword, and before any command option‚Äôs keywords.

Example of command‚Äôs arguments below. The command‚Äôs keyword is underlined.

- `+++<u>add_event</u>+++ Horse ‚Äú24/10/2019 10:00‚Äù`
- `+++<u>delete_event</u>+++ 1 2 3`

==== Argument

A command‚Äôs argument and an option‚Äôs argument are both considered an `Argument`. An argument will be parsed from a command phrase to another object. The `Argument` class is a generic class, where the type of the class defines what type of object the command phrase be parsed into.

For example, an `Argument<DateTime>` which receives ‚Äú24/10/2019 10:00‚Äù will be parsed into a `DateTime` object.


==== Variable Argument

A `VariableArgument` is a special type of argument. A variable argument will be parsed from a list of command phrases to a list of similar type objects. The `VariableArgument` class is a generic class, where the type of the class defines what types of objects the command phrases should be parsed into. A variable argument can accept zero or more command phrases to be parsed.

For example, a `VariableArgument<Integer>` which receives {1, 2, 3} will be parsed into a list of Integers. `A VariableArgument<Integer>` which receives {} will be parsed into an empty list.


==== ArgumentList

A command is said to contain a list of arguments, and it‚Äôs options are said to contain a list of arguments too. Both are considered an `ArgumentList`. An `ArgumentList` is defined to contain zero or more `Arguments`, and zero or one `VariableArguments`.

Additionally, if a variable argument is defined, it will be treated as the last argument in the `ArgumentList`. This is because a variable argument can accept zero or more command phrases, which will prevent other arguments from receiving command phrases if it is not the last argument.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Notification]]
=== Notification System
(Picture: Notification System)

Notifications are handled through the NotificationManager, itself found in the Logic component. There does not exist a singular Notification component. Rather, functional classes for the Notification System are have been split across the Logic and UI components, depending on their functionality.

==== Logic Classes
Logic classes are reponsible for deciding if a notification should be posted. As with other components, their functionality is accessed through the `NotificationManager` class. The `NotificationManager` class maintains a reference to a `NotificationCheckingThread` as well as a `SystemTrayCommunicator`.

The logic classes of the Notification System can be found under the `notification` package under the `Logic` component.

- The `NotificationCheckingThread` is a daemon thread that runs in parallel with the main application. It checks for new notifications to post every minute.
- The `NotificationChecker` is responsible for checking `Model` for any notifications that need to be posted.


==== UI Classes
UI classes are responsible for displaying notifications.

The UI classes of the Notification System can be found under the `systemtray` package under the `ui` component.

- The `PopupListener` class is the main channel of communication between the logic and UI classes. When a notification needs to be posted, it will relay the information from the logic to UI classes.

- The `SystemTrayCommunicator` handles posting notifications and displaying the app's icon on the System Tray.

- The `PopupNotification` class carries the information that will be posted on a popup notification.

- The `NotificationClickActionListener` is called when the user clicks on a popup notification.


[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[[Design-Ics]]
=== Ics Component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ics/IcsParser.java[`IcsParser.java`]

The ICS component is made up of two parts: ICS file importer, and ICS file exporter.

The file importer makes use of a custom parser that converts files with the `.ics` file extension
to `EventSource` objects in Horo.

The file exporter takes the `EventSource` objects stored in the `Model` singleton object and
generates ICS String representations of them. Check out the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar[ICalendar Wiki Page] for more information on the specifications.


* Can export Horo's save data as a file.
* Can import other Horo's save data from a `.ics` file.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
