==== Preface

The purpose of this portfolio is to document the contributions that I have made to a software engineering project, during my second year of study at the National University of Singapore.

==== About the Project

The project was structured to resemble an intermediate stage of a real life software project.
We were tasked to implement enhancements to the software, and also ensure that the finished product can be easily taken over by other developers.

My team of five decided to remix the application to keep track of events and tasks, very much like a calendar application.
Our application, named *Horo*, aims to allow efficient management and organization of daily events and tasks, for any busy student.

For this project, I was given a few critical roles:

. Designing the overall code architecture.
. Implementation of the `Logic` and `Model` in Horo.

==== Major Contribution

[cols="1h, 5a"]
|===
| What
| Design of `CommandManager`, under `Logic`.
The `CommandManager` class manages the addition and invoking of `Commands` in *Horo*.

| Why
| This feature serves to make it very simple for future developers to add new commands.
It was also designed to be very extensible for developers to build upon it.

| Highlights
|
- `CommandBuilder` is an application programming interface (API) for adding new commands.
- `CommandParser` parses user input using a finite state machine (FSM).

==== User Guide Contributions
****
Below are excerpts taken from the User Guide, written by me.
****

=== 3. Features
====
*Command Format for Horo*

* You can enter a command by typing the command name first followed by arguments of the command.
- E.g. `*command_name* <argument1> <argument2>...`

* If you want to type an argument containing blank spaces, surround your sentence within quotation marks.
- E.g. `"Buy Groceries"`
- E.g. `*add_task* "Buy Groceries"`

* Command parameters are prefixed by `--`, and they are optional.
- E.g. `*--date* 09/2019`
- E.g. `*calendar* *--date* 09/2019`
====

====
*Command Format for this User Guide*

* Arguments are fully capitalized which are to be supplied by you.
- E.g. `*add_task* TASK`

* Arguments suffixed with ellipsis (`...`) indicate that the argument can be entered zero or more times.
- E.g. `*delete_task* INDEX...`

* Parameters separated by a vertical bar `|` can be used interchangeably.
- e.g. given the command format `-d|--description DESCRIPTION`, the following inputs accomplish the same thing:
- `*--description* "Buy Groceries"`
- `*-d* "Buy Groceries"`

Events which match both `INDEX` and `TAG` will be deleted. +
`INDEX` can be found on the event's top right corner.

Examples: +
`*delete_event* 1` +
`*delete_event* 1 2 3` : Deletes events 1, 2 and 3. +
`*delete_event* *--tag* Birthday` : Deletes events tagged as `Birthday`. +
`*delete_event* *--tag* Birthday Rori` : Deletes events tagged as `Birthday` and `Rori`. +
`*delete_event* 1 2 3 *--tag* Birthday Rori` : Deletes events 1, 2 and 3 only if they have been tagged as `Birthday` and `Rori`.

==== Developer Guide Contributions
****
Below are excerpts taken from the Developer Guide, written by me.
****

[[Design-CommandManager]]
=== 3.3 CommandManager Component

The `CommandManager` class manages the addition and invoking of `Commands` in Horo.

.Class diagram of CommandManager
image::CommandManagerClassDiagram.png[CommandManager, 550]

Referring to the diagram above, it performs the following operations:

. Listen for user input in `onCommandInput()`.
. Pass the user input to `commandParser`, to obtain a `Command`.
. Execute the `Command` and obtain a `UserOutput`.
. Notify all `userOutputListeners` about the `UserOutput`.

<<<

To give a more concrete example of how `CommandManager` functions, refer to the sequence diagram below of *adding a task* to Horo:

.Sequence diagram of adding a task
image::CommandManagerAddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== 3.3.2 CommandParser

`CommandParser` is trying to tokenize any command input into one command keyword, and zero or more command phrases.
(i.e. `[keyword] [phrase] [phrase] [phrase] ...`).
To understand how the FSM works, study the activity diagram below:

.Activity diagram of CommandParser
image::CommandParserActivityDiagram.png[CommandParser, 300]

=== 3.3.4 CommandBuilder

A `CommandBuilder` is defined to be able to accept an arbitrary amount of command phrases, and eventually create a `Command` using those phrases.

.Class diagram of CommandBuilder
image::CommandBuilderClassDiagram.png[]

Referring to the diagram above, the definition the command is implemented in two methods:

. `defineCommandArguments()`
. `defineCommandOptions()`

...

To understand how `CommandBuilder` works, study the activity diagram below:
