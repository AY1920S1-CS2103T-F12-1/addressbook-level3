== PROJECT: Horo

---

== Overview

Horo is a desktop Reminder application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is a Java application *written in an OOP fashion*, developed and intended for Students requiring a place to consolidate their Events and Task.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: enhanced *UI* component.
** What it does: allows the user to interact with the GUI together with CLI, showing the Events and Task to the user as well as outputting the log for what the user did.
** Justification: This feature is what makes the product visually appealing for the user, making the Events and Tasks compact and concise for the user to see, as well as having a log for what the user previously did.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the current and future commands, as it requires several other components for it to show the result to the user. Future commands or addition to Events and Task requires changes to the existing UI, as the GUI and UI component will require further changes.
