== Introduction

*Horo* is a command-line interface scheduling application. It helps the user maintain a to-do list and a calendar, and posts timely reminders on their desktop. This User Guide provides documentation of *Horo*'s functionalities. Users may refer to this guide as a reference for what the application can do, as well as the commands that Horo will accept..

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `horo.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Horo.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Here are some example commands you can try:

* `**add_event** Celebrate Rori’s Birthday`: adds an event to the event book.
* `**delete** -task 3` : deletes the 3rd event shown in the event book.
* *`exit`* : exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format for Horo*


* The first word of any command should be a non-capitalized keyword, followed by any necessary arguments.
- e.g. `help`
- e.g. `done 1`

* If an argument contains any whitespace, it should be contained between double apostrophes.
- e.g. `delete 1`
- e.g. `add_event "Celebrate Rori's Birthday" "17/09/2019"`

* Any optional arguments should follow the main command, and be preceded by the delimiter `[--parameter name]`.
- e.g. `add_event "Celebrate Rori's Birthday" "17/09/2019 19:00" --remind "16/09/2019 08:00"`
Take note of a mandatory space between the parameters's name and the argument itself. The example:
- e.g. `add_event "Celebrate Rori's Birthday" "17/09/2019 19:00" --remind"16/09/2019 08:00"`
would therefore be invalid.


====
*Command Format specifically for this User Guide*

* Terms that are fully capitalized are user-specified.
- e.g. `event EVENT`

* Terms in square brackets `[]` are optional.
- e.g. `event EVENT [--at DATE_TIME]

* Terms followed by an ellipsis `...` can be used any number of times, including zero.
- e.g. `event EVENT [--at DATE_TIME] [--tag TAG_1] [--tag TAG_2]...`

* Terms separated by a vertical bar `|` can be used interchangeably.
- e.g. given the command format `recur INDEX... [-f|--frequency FREQUENCY]`, the following inputs accomplish the same thing:
- `recur 1 2 3 -f daily`
- `recur 1 2 3 --frequency daily`
